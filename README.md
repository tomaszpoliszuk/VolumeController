# Volume Controller
Control your Volume

## Compatibility
* iOS 13 and above

## What you can do with this tweak:
- **Look of Volume HUD**
	* Disable or select between vertical and horizontal Volume HUD in landscape and portrait positions of device
	* Change size and position of the Volume HUD in both portrait and landscape mode.
	* Choose between the iOS default look and a slim and bold version of it and move the HUD freely on the screen.
- **Volume steps**
	* Default iOS behavior is 16 steps, which means that every time you press one of the volume buttons the volume changes about 6.25%.
	* Volume Controller allows you to change the number of steps it takes to change the volume from 0% to 100%, e.g. a value of 50 means you have to press the volume up button 50 times to go from 0% to maximum volume.

**Configure options from Settings, no respring needed.**
